This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: incorrect order of COPY and RUN instructions.  The original Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies after copying the application code, resulting in a build failure. The fixed Dockerfile corrects this issue by ensuring dependencies are installed before copying the application code.  This is a critical step for ensuring the correct build environment is established before the application code is processed.
